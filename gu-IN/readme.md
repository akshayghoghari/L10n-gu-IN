# Style Guide Gujarati (gu-IN)

## Introduction

Style guides define the standard against which we determine a translation's quality. They contain rules that are both defined by Mozilla and by Mozilla's localization communities on how to best translate text in Mozilla products, websites, and other projects. By following these rules, a translator has a better chance of producing a high quality translation that represents Mozilla values and culture.

## Why should we Localize?

Whenever we are touching a key on a keyboard for translating anything into Gujarati, we are having great responsibility. The responsibility of conveying the message of any source text into Gujarati is having the responsibility to convey to the millions of users. And so the problem is acute.
